Live it up with Live Action Events
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/da64e004-21b0-4e87-bb30-485009a16a2b.jpg)

We are the very best event coordinators, hands down! Lighting, decorating, coordinating, music and food are just a few of the things that we can put together for you. 

Each and every one of our customers gets at least 2 free consultations to ensure that their event is purely magnificent! 

Our standard light shows are made to blow you away and leave your guests in awe. We have intentionally purchased the very best lights on the market and take them to our basic package events; meaning, no matter what package you get from us, it is still nothing but the best. 

Our contacts are extremely deep and have worked with many vendors across the state of North Carolina, ensuring you that all of the vendors at your event will work together seamlessly. With this tool in hand, you are able to show up to your event and enjoy your guests and atmosphere, not having to run around putting out little fires and other issues. 

Our DJs are awesome. With a wealth of knowledge in the art, all of our DJs have studied in music education and/or music productions. Our DJs understand that you are not the type of person who listens to one genre of music! We know you listen to a lot of different types of music; this is why we bring out 2 TBs to every event. If you want to hear a song, we have it. 

Live Action Events gives you all ability to have the perfect event, without you having to lift a single finger! We want to help you "live it up."
